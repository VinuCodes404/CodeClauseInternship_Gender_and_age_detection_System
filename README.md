# CodeClauseInternship_Gender_and_age_detection_System
This project is about a detection system that predicts the age and gender of a person.

Gender-Age Detection System is a deep learning system that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze images of human faces and make predictions about the gender and age of individuals in those images visual data

Key components:
Image dataset, Data Preprocessing, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Model training, Callbacks, Prediction, and visualization.

This Model is at its elementary level, we can integrate the model into real-time applications such as video analysis and security systems for immediate detection is a key avenue for improvement. Moreover, enhancing user experience by incorporating the system into user-facing applications for personalized content recommendations represents another promising direction for development.
